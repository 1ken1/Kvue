          There's a whole new galaxy waiting to be explored! Use the arrow keys
          to run and jump through the space tunnels. Use the left and right
          arrow keys to rotate the world as you go.
          <br />
          <br />
          There are two ways you can play Run 3: Explore Mode and Infinite Mode.
          To add more levels to your Galaxy Map, choose Explore Mode. The Runner
          will encounter lots of new tunnels and areas, and may bump into some
          friends along the way!
          <br />
          <br />
          For an endless run, choose Infinite Mode. You'll find power cells
          scattered across the tunnels in this mode. You'll have to watch your
          step though! If you fall out of the tunnel in Infinite Mode, it's game
          over. You can use power cells to continue your run with a new
          character.

          With all of the levels and characters in Run 3, it can get
          overwhelming while playing. Check out a few tips to help you succeed
          right off the bat.

          There are 9 characters you can unlock as you play through the levels.
          If you save up enough power cells, you can unlock new characters right
          away! Each alien has their own set of skills that will help you
          navigate the galaxy. If you find yourself stuck in a tricky tunnel,
          try swapping out your character for a new one. For example, the Skater
          will perform better in the snow levels!

          <br />
          <br />
          The longer you hold down the up arrow key, the higher and longer
          you'll jump. For platforms with a small gap in between, try tapping
          the up arrow to make a small jump. This technique can help you avoid
          overshooting your landing.

          <b><font size="3">Look ahead</font></b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Put your focus on the platforms just ahead of your character. Take
          note of all the different sides of the tunnel to plan your next jumps.
          This should help you determine which way to turn the tunnels so that
          your character has plenty of space to run.

          <br />
          Infinite Mode is great for collecting power cells to unlock
          characters, but it can also be great for practice too! If you're stuck
          on a level on the galaxy map, try a few runs through the infinite
          tunnels. The tunnels won't be the same every time, so you'll get a
          good feel for the different obstacles.

          <br />
          <br />
          Run 3 is playable without flash, as well as the original Run game.
          Getting these games up after Adobe Flash Player was no longer
          supported has been a priority of ours. We have converted it from Flash
          to HTML, along with roughly 100 other games.

          <br />
          <br />
          Run 3 came out about a decade ago, somewhere between 2013 and 2014
          depending on who you ask. While it didn't get uploaded to Coolmath
          Games until 2017, it became an instant hit once it was published on
          the website. Fans tend to be drawn to this game for its fast-paced
          gameplay and creative characters, even years after it was first put on
          our site.

          <br />
          Yes, the first Run 3 character that you start out with, Runner, is a
          girl. As you proceed through the game you will get all sorts of
          different characters such as Skater, Lizard, and Bunny. Utilize all of
          their unique abilities in order to succeed in this popular platformer
          game.
